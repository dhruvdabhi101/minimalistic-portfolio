# how i manage 75% attendance ?
my college has strict rules for attendance. they often check for proxies. it is mostly a school at this point. there is no room for learning by our own at this point. so i had to learn new things otherwise i will get some basic ass package from on-campus placement. so here are the few things that i follow to get maximum amount of free time from the college. 

1. check for teachers that are liberal and doesn't check for proxy, they are great way to get out of the class and learn new things, be ready to get caught in proxy, because they might check sometimes, use this at your own risk
2. ask your friends for assignments, and write those assignments in lectures that are not interesting to you.
3. follow same method to prepare for the exams as well. learn as much as possible to do your all college work in classroom.
4. check for holidays which gives you longer holiday streak. if you get holiday on thurday and friday and your college has saturday and sunday holiday already then bunk those two 3 days to get a week off of your college.
5. Be friends with toppers or students who are into studies, they will help you learn topics before exams and will help you in assignments.
6. calculate how many more lectures you can bunk next.
7. ask your family doctor to make you a fake medical certificate. ( for only educational purpose only )
8. don't waste time at home sleeping and watching reels, if you have bunked a lecture and utilize as a lecture at home.
